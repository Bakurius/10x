      <h1>Web Development</h1>
      <p>
        <strong>Web development</strong> is the work involved in developing a
        <a href="#">website</a> for the <a href="#">Internet</a> (<a href="#"
          >World Wide Web</a
        >) or an <a href="#">intranet</a> (a private network).<sup
          ><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
        >
        Web development can range from developing a simple single
        <a href="#">static page</a> of <a href="#">plain text</a> to complex
        <a>web applications</a>, <a href="#">electronic businesses</a>, and
        <a href="#">social network services</a>. A more comprehensive list of
        tasks to which Web development commonly refers may include
        <em>Web engineering</em>, <em>Web design</em>,
        <em>Web content development</em>, client liaison,
        <em>client-side/server-side scripting</em>, Web server and network
        security configuration, and e-commerce development.
      </p>
      <p>
        Among Web professionals, "Web development" usually refers to the main
        non-design aspects of building Web sites: writing markup and coding. Web
        development may use <strong>content management systems (CMS)</strong> to
        make content changes easier and available with basic technical skills.

      <h2>Evolution of the World Wide Web and web development</h2>

      <h3>Origin/ Web 1.0</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>Tim Berners-Lee</strong> created the World Wide Web in 1989 at
        CERN. The primary goal in the development of the Web was to fulfill the
        automated information-sharing needs of academics affiliated with
        institutions and various global organizations. Consequently,
        <em>HTML</em> was developed in 1993. Web 1.0 is described as the first
        paradigm wherein users could only view material and provide a small
        amount of information. Core protocols of Web 1.0 were <em>HTTP</em>,
        <em>HTML</em> and <em>URI</em>.
      </p>

      <h3>Web 2.0</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>Web 2.0</strong>, a term popularised in the mid-2000s, marks a
        shift in internet usage, emphasizing interactivity. Web 2.0 introduced
        increased user engagement and communication. It evolved from the static,
        read-only nature of Web 1.0 and became an integrated network for
        engagement and communication. It is often referred to as a user-focused,
        read-write online network.
      </p>

      <h3>Web 3.0</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>Web 3.0</strong>, considered the third and current version of
        the web, envisions deeper integration of metadata, more precise
        information delivery, and improved user experiences based on
        preferences, history, and interests. This version is sometimes also
        known as the <em>Semantic Web</em> and aims to turn the web into a
        sizable, organized database providing smarter, more personalized
        functionality.
      </p>

      <h3>Evolution of web development technologies</h3>
      <p>
        Over time web development technologies progressed through several key
        stages:
